**Exercise Front**

## Live Demo

You can find a live demo [here](https://fssantos.github.io/exercisefront). **IMPORTANT**: since dev.4all is over HTTP, you should allow Chrome to "load unsafe scripts" otherwise all requests won't be processed.

## Usage

    sudo npm install
    sudo npm run start

It will start running on localhost:3000/

## Tools

This projects uses Webpack 4.0 as bundler, React as frontend library, Redux as state management library, whatwg-fetch to requests, and Flexbox in order to achieve a responsible layout.
